/**
 * Decoro configuration. Edit this file to point Decoro at your preferred LLM
 * provider and model. API keys are read from environment variables (see
 * `.env.example` at the repo root); do not hard-code them here.
 *
 * Lives next to the Next.js app (rather than the repo root that
 * `docs/architecture.md` originally sketched) for two practical reasons:
 *   1. pnpm does not hoist workspace packages to the repo root, so a config at
 *      the repo root cannot resolve `@decoro/llm-config`.
 *   2. Next.js picks up `apps/web/.env.local` for the API key without extra
 *      wiring when this file is consumed from `apps/web` server code.
 *
 * Switching providers is a one-line change. The library design hypothesis
 * (ADR-003) is verified primarily on Anthropic Claude — the other branches
 * are wired so contributors can smoke-test without an Anthropic key.
 *
 * Vercel AI Gateway (default — free monthly credit, one key reaches every
 * provider, lowest setup friction):
 *   { provider: 'gateway', model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6',
 *     apiKey: process.env['AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY'] }
 *
 * Anthropic direct:
 *   { provider: 'anthropic', model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
 *     apiKey: process.env['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'] }
 *
 * Google Gemini direct (free tier):
 *   { provider: 'google', model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
 *     apiKey: process.env['GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY'] }
 *
 * Local Claude CLI (subscription-backed monkey testing — no API key):
 *   { provider: 'subprocess-claude', model: 'sonnet' }
 * Spawns the locally installed `claude` binary per request and adapts its
 * `--print --output-format stream-json` output. Uses whatever account
 * `claude` is logged into. Process spawn adds ~1.5s/turn so this is for
 * manual dogfood only — keep an API-backed provider for tests / CI.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — subscription terms: this provider consumes the operator's
 * personal Claude.ai subscription quota (5-hour rate limit). It is OK to
 * use locally for self-driven dogfood, but DO NOT ship a deployment
 * pointed at this provider — exposing your subscription as a backend for
 * other users would violate Anthropic's ToS (effectively reselling
 * Claude). Production / multi-user deployments must use an API-backed
 * provider (`gateway`, `anthropic`, `google`).
 *
 * Adapter selection lives elsewhere for now — apps/web pins
 * `@decoro/adapter-arte-odyssey` directly. A `defineConfig` helper that
 * bundles adapter + LLM together can ship once we have a second adapter to
 * motivate the abstraction (per ADR-004).

/**
 * Adapter binding. Pinned here so the rest of `apps/web` consumes the
 * adapter through the abstract `Adapter` contract — `code-panel.tsx`,
 * `preview/page.tsx`, and `/api/generate` all import this rather than
 * `@decoro/adapter-arte-odyssey` directly. Switching to a future
 * `@decoro/adapter-mui` etc. is a one-line change here, no consumer churn.
 *
 * Per ADR-004 we deliberately do not introduce a `defineConfig({ adapter,
 * llm })` wrapper — there's only one adapter today and one config field
 * pattern is enough for both bindings.
